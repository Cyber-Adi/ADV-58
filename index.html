            <p>
                The main reason I like reading is because you are basically transported into a whole new world. Being able to sit down and get so immersed in the book pushed all my worries away, and really helped when I thought my head would explode from over-thinking things.

                The second reason I like reading is because I can read the same book a million times and still find new things I hadn’t notice in the story before. I’ve probably read Harry Potter over twenty times and every time I find something completely new. Whether it was a small detail or foreshadowing a huge scene. Books never get old. That’s the best thing about reading; I could read the same book over and over again and never get bored of it. Books will always be amazing to me.
